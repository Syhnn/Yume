# Yume
When I created my last project (3D Projection) I realized that I was rewriting a lot of code that I had already worked on in the past (which is bad). 
In order to avoid that I decided to create a library that I'll be able to use for all my future projects. 
There isn't much yet, but I decided to push it on GitHub anyway because I don't want to suddently make a big commit with everything in it. 
That way I'll be able to track my progression.
